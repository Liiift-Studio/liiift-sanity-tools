# GitHub Projects Action Plan

## Current Status ✅

- All 13 Sanity tools successfully pushed to individual GitHub repositories
- All repositories have clean working trees with no uncommitted changes
- Complete overview document created with technical specifications

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Projects (Priority: High)

For each repository, create GitHub Projects with the following structure:

#### Repositories to Set Up:

1. `sanity-advanced-reference-array`
2. `sanity-bulk-data-operations`
3. `sanity-convert-ids-to-slugs`
4. `sanity-convert-references`
5. `sanity-delete-unused-assets`
6. `sanity-duplicate-and-rename`
7. `sanity-enhanced-commerce`
8. `sanity-export-data`
9. `sanity-font-data-extractor`
10. `sanity-font-management-suite`
11. `sanity-renewals-authorization`
12. `sanity-search-and-delete`
13. `sanity-studio-utilities`

#### Project Setup Checklist:

- [ ] Create "Development Pipeline" project board
- [ ] Add columns: Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done
- [ ] Create "Feature Categories" project board
- [ ] Add columns: Core Features, UI/UX, Performance, Documentation, Testing
- [ ] Set up milestones: v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v2.0
- [ ] Create issue templates: Bug Report, Feature Request, Documentation, Performance

### 2. Documentation Enhancement (Priority: High)

#### For Each Repository:

- [ ] Enhance README.md with detailed usage examples
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
- [ ] Include installation and setup instructions

### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance (Priority: Medium)

#### Testing Setup:

- [ ] Add Jest testing framework
- [ ] Create unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Set up integration tests
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting

### 4. Package Preparation (Priority: Medium)

#### NPM Package Setup:

- [ ] Configure package.json for publishing
- [ ] Set up proper versioning strategy
- [ ] Create build scripts for distribution
- [ ] Test package installation locally
- [ ] Prepare for NPM registry publication

### 5. Community & Discoverability (Priority: Low)

#### Community Building:

- [ ] Add topics/tags to repositories
- [ ] Create social media announcements
- [ ] Submit to Sanity plugin registry
- [ ] Write blog posts about the tools
- [ ] Engage with Sanity community

## Quick Start Commands

### Create GitHub Project (via CLI):

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
brew install gh

# For each repository:
gh project create --title "Development Pipeline" --body "Main development workflow"
gh project create --title "Feature Categories" --body "Feature-based organization"
```

### Set Up Issue Templates:

```bash
# Create .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory in each repo
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/

# Add template files:
# - bug_report.md
# - feature_request.md
# - documentation.md
# - performance.md
```

## Notes

- All repositories are currently private - consider making them public when ready
- Each tool is production-ready with proper error handling and user feedback
- Consistent architecture across all tools makes maintenance easier
- Ready for community contributions once projects are set up

**Next Action**: Begin creating GitHub Projects for the first repository
