## Conclusion

This comprehensive GitHub Projects proposal provides a systematic approach to managing our 13 Sanity tools collection. The standardized project structure ensures consistency while allowing for tool-specific customization. The implementation timeline is realistic and achievable, with clear success metrics to track progress.

The proposal balances immediate needs (project organization and issue tracking) with long-term goals (community engagement and sustainable development). By implementing this structure, we create a foundation for successful open-source project management and community contribution.

**Recommended First Step**: Begin with pilot implementation on 3 repositories to validate the approach before full rollout.
